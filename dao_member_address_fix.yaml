title: "DAO Member Address Validation Fix"
version: "1.0.0"
date: "2023-06-15"
author: "Deffy Team"
status: "Completed"

problem_statement:
  summary: "The system was incorrectly treating member addresses as DAO addresses when adding members to a DAO"
  details:
    - "When users attempted to add a member to a DAO, the system would validate the member address as if it were a DAO address"
    - "This caused 'No DAO contract found at address' errors when trying to add valid wallet addresses as members"
    - "The issue occurred in the session management flow where input validation didn't properly distinguish between DAO and member addresses"
    - "The callback data for confirmation buttons exceeded Telegram's 64-byte limit, causing BUTTON_DATA_INVALID errors"
    - "Session data wasn't properly maintained between callbacks, causing the DAO address to be lost during confirmation"

root_causes:
  validation_logic:
    - "The handleDAOManageInput method in SessionManager.ts always validated input as a DAO address regardless of context"
    - "No specific validation path existed for member addresses in the 'add' flow"
  
  session_management:
    - "The DAO address wasn't consistently stored in the session for later retrieval"
    - "Callback data format was too long for Telegram's limitations"
    - "No direct property existed in the session to store and retrieve the DAO address"
  
  type_definitions:
    - "The DAOManageSession interface lacked a memberAddress property"

resolution_steps:
  step_1:
    title: "Improve error messages in DAOService"
    description: "Updated getDAOInfo method to provide more specific error messages"
    changes:
      - file: "src/services/DAOService.ts"
        details: "Changed error message from 'No DAO contract found at address' to 'No contract code at address: [address] - This appears to be a regular wallet address, not a DAO contract'"
    benefits:
      - "More descriptive error messages help users understand the issue"
      - "Distinguishes between wallet addresses and contract addresses"

  step_2:
    title: "Update SessionManager to handle member addresses"
    description: "Modified handleDAOManageInput to skip DAO validation for member addresses"
    changes:
      - file: "src/services/telegram/SessionManager.ts"
        details: "Added logic to skip DAO validation when action is 'add' and a DAO is already selected"
    benefits:
      - "Prevents member addresses from being validated as DAO addresses"
      - "Creates a specific validation path for member addresses"

  step_3:
    title: "Update DAOManageSession type definition"
    description: "Added memberAddress property to the DAOManageSession interface"
    changes:
      - file: "src/services/telegram/types.ts"
        details: "Added memberAddress?: string to the DAOManageSession interface"
    benefits:
      - "Provides proper type support for storing member addresses"
      - "Resolves TypeScript errors related to the missing property"

  step_4:
    title: "Fix callback data length issue"
    description: "Shortened callback data to comply with Telegram's 64-byte limit"
    changes:
      - file: "src/services/telegram/SessionManager.ts"
        details: "Changed callback_data from dao_confirm_add_${session.data.daoAddress}_${input} to dao_confirm_add_${input}"
    benefits:
      - "Resolves BUTTON_DATA_INVALID errors from Telegram"
      - "Maintains essential information while reducing data size"

  step_5:
    title: "Update callback handler for new format"
    description: "Modified handleDAOConfirmAddCallback to work with the new callback data format"
    changes:
      - file: "src/services/telegram/CallbackHandlers.ts"
        details: "Updated to extract only the member address from dao_confirm_add_ callback and retrieve DAO address from session"
    benefits:
      - "Aligns with the new shortened callback data format"
      - "Maintains functionality despite the format change"

  step_6:
    title: "Improve session data persistence"
    description: "Added direct DAO address storage in session for reliable retrieval"
    changes:
      - file: "src/services/telegram/SessionManager.ts"
        details: "Added ctx.session.currentDaoAddress = session.data.daoAddress to store DAO address directly"
      - file: "src/services/telegram/CallbackHandlers.ts"
        details: "Updated to check ctx.session.currentDaoAddress first before falling back to other methods"
    benefits:
      - "Ensures DAO address is consistently available throughout the flow"
      - "Provides multiple fallback methods for retrieving the DAO address"
      - "Makes the process more robust against session data loss"

testing:
  scenarios:
    - "Adding a member with a valid wallet address to a DAO"
    - "Confirming the addition through the confirmation button"
  results:
    - "Member successfully added to the DAO"
    - "Transaction confirmed on-chain"
    - "No validation errors or Telegram API errors"

lessons_learned:
  - "Session management in multi-step flows requires careful consideration of data persistence"
  - "External API limitations (like Telegram's 64-byte limit) must be accounted for in design"
  - "Type definitions should be updated alongside functional changes to maintain type safety"
  - "Multiple fallback mechanisms for critical data improve system robustness"
  - "Clear error messages that distinguish between different types of addresses improve user experience"

future_improvements:
  - "Create a more comprehensive validation framework that adapts based on context"
  - "Implement a more structured session management system with better type safety"
  - "Add more extensive logging for easier debugging of multi-step flows"
  - "Consider implementing a minimal DAO ABI for more consistent function detection"
